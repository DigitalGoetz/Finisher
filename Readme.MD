# Finisher

This is simply an image with the intent to create containers that run for a specific duration (or duration pattern) and successfully complete.

## Prerequisites

* Docker Engine: This particular Dockerfile doesn't do anything special, so you're likely safe going back to something like 1.10.0 or something ancient if you're really into self-harm.  I'm going to recommend version 18.01 for sanity's sake.
